# digital-forensic-toolkit
This toolkit leverages Autopsy (a GUI front-end for Sleuth Kit), Sleuth Kit (command-line tools for disk analysis), Volatility (memory forensics), and FTK Imager (for evidence acquisition). These open-source or freely available tools form a robust, integrated suite for collecting and analyzing evidence from compromised systems.
